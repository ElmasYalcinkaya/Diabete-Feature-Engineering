# Diabetes Feature Engineering

## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model that can predict whether individuals have diabetes. The model will be trained using a dataset of Pima Indian women living in Phoenix, Arizona. The key tasks include performing exploratory data analysis and feature engineering before model development.

## Dataset

The dataset is part of a larger set from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases in the USA. It includes 768 observations and 9 variables:

- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- Blood Pressure
- Skin Thickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- Diabetes Pedigree Function
- Age
- Outcome (1 for positive diabetes test result, 0 for negative)
